🚀 **Deep Research: OpenAI’s Game-Changing AI Agent**  
OpenAI just dropped **Deep Research**, their latest AI agent, and it’s a *huge* leap forward. Imagine an AI that can spend 5 to 30 minutes scouring the web, synthesizing data, and delivering a polished, fully cited report. Whether you’re analyzing markets, writing research papers, or even shopping for skis, this tool is designed to save you hours of manual effort.  

🔍 **What Makes Deep Research Special?**  
- **Multi-Step Research**: It browses the web, analyzes text, images, and PDFs, and adapts its plan as it uncovers new information.  
- **Clarifying Questions**: Before diving in, it asks for details to ensure it’s on the right track—just like a human analyst would.  
- **Custom Outputs**: Need a formatted report with tables? Done. Want a deep dive into niche topics? Easy.  

💡 **Real-World Use Cases**  
- **Market Research**: Analyze mobile adoption rates or language learning trends across countries.  
- **Personal Shopping**: Find the perfect pair of skis tailored to your preferences (yes, it even considers color palettes!).  
- **Medical Insights**: Upload a pathology report and get a detailed analysis of treatment options, complete with cited studies.  

📊 **Benchmark-Breaking Performance**  
Deep Research scored **26.6% accuracy** on *Humanity’s Last Exam*, a benchmark with 3,000 questions across 100 subjects. It’s also excelling in expert-level tasks, saving professionals hours of manual research.  

🤖 **The AGI Connection**  
This isn’t just about research—it’s a step toward **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**. OpenAI envisions agents that can think autonomously for longer periods, tackling increasingly complex tasks.  

💻 **Availability**
